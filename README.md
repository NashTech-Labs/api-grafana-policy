## Using Grafana Api to acces grafana and apply CRUD actions
This template helps you to create Notification policies and view them from your grafana server

Note: Here we just add routes for different channels in existing policy

You can create API key using UI or follow the instructions of [Curl Commands Help](./curlAPIcommand.md)

Then use 
    1. [View](./getnotificationpolicyInfo.py) : to view the available alert rules
    2. [Create](./modifynotificationpolicy.py) : to add new rules
